</p>

A [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) plugin that renders [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams alongside Markdown previews — for terminals with image protocol support (Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, iTerm2).

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Inline mermaid diagrams** — split-mode previewer composes glow-rendered text with a mermaid image right in the preview pane
- 🌐 **Offline backend** — `mmdc` (mermaid-cli) support for air-gapped / locked-down networks
- 🔄 **Mode toggle** — split / image-only / text-only via keymap
- 🔎 **Image-area zoom** — 8 step sizes (6 → 40 rows)
- ⚡️ **Snappy scrolling** — ANSI cache for glow + on-disk cache for mermaid images
- 🛡️ **Useful errors** — surfaces mermaid.ink's JSON parse error verbatim instead of curl's generic stderr
- 🛠 **Configurable** — `setup({...})` for format, endpoint, timeouts, default zoom, read limit
- 🪶 **Light install option** — release tarball ships only `main.lua` + `README` + `LICENSE`

## Why

`glow`, `mdcat`, and friends render Markdown beautifully in the terminal, but `mermaid` code blocks are passed through as raw text. This plugin extracts those blocks, sends them to [mermaid.ink](https://mermaid.ink) for rendering, and displays the resulting images alongside the text in the preview pane.

## Status

| Milestone | State |
|---|---|
| A1 — preview `.mmd` / `.mermaid` files as images | ✅ |
| A2 — extract ` ```mermaid ` blocks from `.md` files and render them | ✅ |
| A3 — composite md text + mermaid image in one preview | ✅ (bottom-anchored split mode; see [#3](https://github.com/passion0102/mermaid.yazi/issues/3) for the abandoned inline-embedded R&D) |
| Glow fallback for plain `.md` (no mermaid blocks) | ✅ |
| Mode toggle (split / image / text) + image zoom | ✅ |
| Offline `mmdc` backend / release tarball / demo screenshot | ✅ (all shipped as of v0.2.0) |

## Requirements

- [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) 25.5 or later
- A terminal with [Kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/) support (Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm) **or** iTerm2 inline images
- [`glow`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) on `PATH` for the markdown text rendering layer
- Internet access for the default [mermaid.ink](https://mermaid.ink) backend

Optional but recommended:

- `coreutils` on macOS (`brew install coreutils`) so `gtimeout` is available. The plugin uses it to wrap `glow` with a 15 s wall-clock cap; without it a wedged `glow` would freeze the preview pipeline.

## Installation

### Via `ya pkg add` (default)

```sh
ya pkg add passion0102/mermaid
```

This clones the entire repository into `~/.config/yazi/plugins/mermaid.yazi/`, including the `lib/` sources and `spec/` tests used for development. yazi only ever loads `main.lua`, so the extra files are harmless but cost a few hundred kilobytes of disk.

### Manual install from release tarball (lightweight)

For environments that prefer not to pull dev sources (CI images, locked-down workstations, install scripts), grab a release tarball:

```sh
# Replace v0.1.0 with the latest tag from
# https://github.com/passion0102/mermaid.yazi/releases
version="v0.1.0"
mkdir -p ~/.config/yazi/plugins
curl -sSL "https://github.com/passion0102/mermaid.yazi/releases/download/${version}/mermaid.yazi-${version}.tar.gz" \
  | tar -xz -C ~/.config/yazi/plugins
```

The tarball contains only `main.lua`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` inside a `mermaid.yazi/` directory. The release workflow ([.github/workflows/release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml)) builds it automatically on every `v*` tag push.

### yazi configuration

After either install path, add to `~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml`:

```toml
[plugin]
prepend_previewers = [
  { url = "*.md",       run = "mermaid" },
  { url = "*.mmd",      run = "mermaid" },
  { url = "*.mermaid",  run = "mermaid" },
]
```

> **Note:** the previewer match field is `url`. An older draft of these docs used `name`, which yazi silently ignores. The canonical field list is documented under [Configuration → `[plugin]`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/configuration/yazi).

## Operation

The plugin has three preview modes, switched at runtime through `~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml`:

| Mode | What you see in the preview pane |
|---|---|
| `split` (default) | glow-rendered text on top, the currently selected mermaid block image at the bottom |
| `image` | full preview area is the mermaid image (max zoom equivalent) |
| `text` | full preview area is the glow-rendered text, no image |

An image zoom steps through `{ 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 40 }` rows. Default is **12** rows. The cap is roughly 70 % of the preview height, so large terminals see the full step set.

### Recommended keymap

Add the following to `~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml`. The example uses `z` / `+` / `-`, which conflict with some yazi / zoxide setups — feel free to remap. Modifier-bearing keys like `<A-m>`, `<A-=>`, `<A-->` rarely conflict.

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = "z"
run = "plugin mermaid -- toggle-mode"
desc = "Toggle mermaid preview mode (split / image / text)"

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = "+"
run = "plugin mermaid -- zoom-in"
desc = "mermaid: enlarge image area"

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = "-"
run = "plugin mermaid -- zoom-out"
desc = "mermaid: shrink image area"
```

Direct mode pinning is also available if you'd rather not cycle:

```
plugin mermaid -- split
plugin mermaid -- image
plugin mermaid -- text
```

### Scrolling long documents

Use yazi's standard preview-scroll keys (`Shift+J` / `Shift+K`, `<C-d>` / `<C-u>`, trackpad). The plugin honors `job.units` directly so multi-row gestures land the documented number of rows.

In `split` mode the bottom mermaid image **auto-selects** whichever block falls inside the visible window. The caption carries a `~` to indicate that the selection is approximate — glow's decorated and wrapped output rows don't always line up exactly with raw md line numbers.

## Configuration

The plugin accepts user overrides through `M:setup(opts)`. Add the call to `~/.config/yazi/init.lua`:

```lua
require("mermaid"):setup({
  -- All keys are optional; defaults shown.
  backend = "auto",                 -- "auto" | "mermaid.ink" | "mmdc"
  format = "png",                   -- "png" | "svg"
  endpoint = "https://mermaid.ink", -- HTTP base (kroki / self-hosted work too)
  timeout = 10,                     -- curl --max-time, seconds
  glow_timeout = 15,                -- wall-clock cap on glow, seconds
  image_rows = nil,                 -- nil = follow zoom step; integer = fixed rows
  read_limit_mb = 8,                -- ceiling on io.read
})
```

| key | type | default | what it changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backend` | `"auto"` / `"mermaid.ink"` / `"mmdc"` | `"auto"` | Image rendering backend. `auto` picks [`mmdc`](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) when it's on `PATH`, otherwise falls back to the HTTP `endpoint`. Force `"mmdc"` for offline / locked-down networks; force `"mermaid.ink"` to keep the HTTP path even when `mmdc` is installed |
| `format` | `"png"` / `"svg"` | `"png"` | Output format. SVG needs a yazi build with resvg; PNG is the safer default |
| `endpoint` | string | `"https://mermaid.ink"` | HTTP base used when the resolved backend is `mermaid.ink`. Point this at a self-hosted [kroki](https://kroki.io) for an in-network HTTP path; trailing slashes are stripped |
| `timeout` | seconds | `10` | curl `--max-time` cap for image fetches (mermaid.ink path only) |
| `glow_timeout` | seconds | `15` | wall-clock cap for `glow`. Only active when `gtimeout` (macOS via coreutils) or `timeout` (Linux) is on `PATH` |
| `image_rows` | integer or `nil` | `nil` | when set, pins the image area height. The `zoom-in` / `zoom-out` keymap entries override this once they've written to the persisted zoom step |
| `read_limit_mb` | integer | `8` | maximum file size we read. Markdown bigger than this surfaces `file exceeds N MB` and the preview is disabled — mermaid blocks past the cap would be invisible to the parser |

### Offline / air-gapped install

If you can't reach `mermaid.ink`, install [`mermaid-cli`](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) and force the `mmdc` backend:

```sh
# One-time install (requires npm and Chromium for Playwright)
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

```lua
require("mermaid"):setup({ backend = "mmdc" })
```

`mmdc` renders each block to disk directly — no HTTP, no `mermaid.ink` dependency. Tradeoff: the first render in a session spawns a fresh Chromium and can take a couple of seconds; subsequent peeks hit the cache.

## Error reference

The plugin surfaces these messages in the preview pane when something goes wrong:

| Message | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `mermaid.yazi: cannot open file (...)` | `io.open` failed (permissions, symlink loop, missing file) | Check the file is readable |
| `mermaid.yazi: empty file` | `io.read` returned no bytes | Likely a 0-byte file |
| `mermaid.yazi: file exceeds 8 MB; preview disabled` | The md is larger than the 8 MB read cap | Open it externally; mermaid blocks past 8 MB are invisible to the parser |
| `mermaid.yazi: no mermaid blocks found` | A `.md` file has no ` ```mermaid ` blocks and the glow fallback couldn't run | Install `glow` for the markdown text fallback, or verify the fence syntax |
| `mermaid.yazi: fetch failed (...)` | curl couldn't download from mermaid.ink — the parenthetical contains curl's stderr | Check connectivity; the embedded curl error usually pinpoints the cause |
| `(glow failed or timed out — will retry on next peek)` | glow exited non-zero or hit the 15 s wall-clock cap | Re-trigger the peek; if it persists the md may be huge or glow may be wedged |

## Development

```sh
# One-time toolchain setup
brew install lua luarocks stylua selene coreutils
luarocks install --local busted
export PATH="$HOME/.luarocks/bin:$PATH"

# Run tests
busted

# Lint and format
selene lib
stylua --check .
stylua .          # format in place
```

Run a single spec file:

```sh
busted spec/parser_spec.lua
```

> `main.lua` ships with parser / encoder / cache inlined because yazi's `require` only resolves plugin-level modules (`<plugin>.<file>` → `<plugin>.yazi/<file>.lua`). The `lib/` sources are the source of truth for TDD; re-bundle into `main.lua` by hand when editing.
